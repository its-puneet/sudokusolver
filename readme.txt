Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm in Python

This project mainly focuses on solving sudoku puzzles with full accuracy as well as efficency. It uses backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles. GUI form of this code will be updated soon.
Language used-Python

Backtracking algorithm-Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
